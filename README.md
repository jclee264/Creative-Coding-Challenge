 ## Coding Challenge Information
  * [Coding Challenge #166: Lissajous Curve Table](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/116-lissajous.html) 
  * After watching the video, I visited [this link](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/processing/) 
    to brush up on my processing information before beggining to refactor the code.
  * I then opened up processing on my computer, and coded along with Dan to make sure I fully understood what I was
    coding (as opposed to just copy and pasting the code)
