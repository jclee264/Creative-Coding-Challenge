 ## Coding Challenge Information
  * [Coding Challenge #166: Lissajous Curve Table](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/116-lissajous.html) 
  * After watching the video, I visited [this link](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/processing/) 
    to brush up on my processing information before beggining to refactor the code.
  * I then opened up processing on my computer, and coded along with Dan to make sure I fully understood what I was
    coding (as opposed to just copy and pasting the code)
  * After coding with Dan and documenting the code so I could remember what each part of the code did, I had to decide
    what creative things I was going to add to the code. 
 
 ## Creative Add-ins
  1) Changing the colours of the curves across the column
