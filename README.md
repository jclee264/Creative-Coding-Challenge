 ## Coding Challenge Information
  * [Coding Challenge #166: Lissajous Curve Table](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/116-lissajous.html) 
  * After watching the video, I visited [this link](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/processing/) 
    to brush up on my processing information before beggining to refactor the code.
  * I then opened up processing on my computer, and coded along with Dan to make sure I fully understood what I was
    coding (as opposed to just copy and pasting the code)
  * After coding with Dan and documenting the code so I could remember what each part of the code did, I had to decide
    what creative things I was going to add to the code. 
 
 ## Creative Add-ins
  1) Changing the colours of the curves as time progresses
        * I used [this link](https://processing.org/reference/frameCount.html) to figure out what frameCount and frameRate 
          was and then used it to make the colour change (with if statements) as the frameCount got higher. Remembering that
          when the curve drawing reset, the frameCount also had to be reset. 
  2) Adding words behind the curves 
        * bla bla
